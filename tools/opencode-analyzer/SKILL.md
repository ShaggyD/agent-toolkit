# opencode-analyzer

OpenCode cost analyzer with detailed daily/weekly/monthly breakdowns. Shows what you actually spent vs what it would cost on OpenRouter, plus same-token model comparisons.

**SCOPE:** This skill covers **OpenCode** cost analysis only. OpenCode and OpenAI Codex CLI are separate tools with separate cost databases. Do NOT use this to analyze Codex CLI costs — see `references/codex-cli-monitoring.md`.

## What It Does

Queries your local OpenCode SQLite database to show:
- Daily, weekly, and monthly spending
- Average costs per day/week/month
- Cost projections
- Top models by spending
- OpenRouter cost equivalents for free models
- Same-token repricing across comparable model tiers

## Installation

```bash
# Copy to your skills directory
cp -r skills/opencode-analyzer ~/.config/opencode/skills/

# Or create symlink to command
ln -s ~/.config/opencode/skills/opencode-analyzer/opencode-cost ~/.local/bin/opencode-cost
```

Optional plugin sources are stored in `plugins/`.

## Plugin behavior (optional)

When enabled in a compatible OpenCode runtime, the plugin layer is intended to:

- Surface quick spend context inside OpenCode (today, yesterday, 7d, 30d)
- Use actual costs for paid usage and OpenRouter estimates for free-model usage
- Show rolling averages and a short top-model cost list

If your runtime does not expose plugin sidebar UI, use the command path (`opencode-cost` and `/cost-report`), which is the primary supported workflow for this skill.

## Usage

```bash
# Show complete cost breakdown
opencode-cost
```

## Sections Explained

### 📅 Spending by Period
- **Today**: Current day's spending
- **Yesterday**: Previous day's spending  
- **Last 7 Days**: Week total
- **Last 30 Days**: Month total
- **All Time**: Complete history

### 📊 Averages
- **Daily/Weekly/Monthly (30d)**: Rolling averages based on the last 30 calendar days
- **Daily Avg (active)**: Average per active day across all-time usage

### 🔮 Projection
- **Projected (7d run-rate)**: Based on last 7 days active-day run rate × 30

### 🧪 Model Comparison (Same 7d Tokens)
- Uses your exact last 7 days input/output token totals
- Pulls current trending models from OpenRouter rankings
- Reprices those same tokens across comparable model tiers
- Shows 7-day repriced cost and 30-day run-rate per model
- Helps compare options without changing usage volume

### ☁️ AWS vs OpenRouter (30d from 7d usage)
- Uses your exact last 7 days tokens and projects to 30 days
- Compares AWS us-east on-demand rates vs OpenRouter model rates
- Includes Claude Sonnet/Opus 4.6 (and Long Context on AWS), DeepSeek, Kimi, GLM, Qwen, and Minimax
- Rounds displayed values up to the nearest cent for budget planning
- Adds `ZDR` column (whether model has at least one OpenRouter ZDR endpoint)
- Adds `MM` column (whether the model supports non-text inputs)

### 📈 Activity
- Active days plus total calendar span since first usage

### 🔥 Top Models
- Most expensive models (by cost, not tokens)
- Shows cost and percentage of monthly total

## Cost Calculation

**Paid models**: Uses actual cost from OpenCode  
**Free models**: Uses OpenRouter pricing:

| Model | Input | Output |
|-------|-------|--------|
| GLM 4.6 | $0.30/M | $2.55/M |
| Kimi K2.5 | $0.50/M | $2.40/M |
| Gemini 2.5 Flash | $0.30/M | $2.50/M |
| GPT-5.3 Codex | $1.25/M | $10.00/M |
| MiniMax M2.5 | $0.15/M | $0.60/M |
| Claude Opus | $5.00/M | $25.00/M |
| Qwen | $0.40/M | $2.40/M |

Comparison table dynamically selects current OpenRouter trending models in value, balanced, and premium classes. If live fetch fails, it falls back to a stable default set.

## Database Location

Auto-detects from:
- `~/.local/share/opencode/opencode.db` (default)
- `~/Library/Application Support/opencode/opencode.db` (macOS)

## Requirements

- sqlite3 (usually pre-installed)
- bc (for calculations, usually pre-installed)

## Examples

```bash
# Default breakdown
opencode-cost

# Use specific database
opencode-cost --db /path/to/opencode.db
```

## Troubleshooting

### Database not found
```bash
# Find your database
find ~ -name "opencode.db" 2>/dev/null

# Specify path
opencode-cost --db /path/to/opencode.db
```

### Permission denied
```bash
chmod 644 ~/.local/share/opencode/opencode.db
```

### sqlite3 not found
```bash
# macOS
brew install sqlite

# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt-get install sqlite3
```

## Notes

- Negative values (refunds/adjustments) are excluded
- Free models show OpenRouter equivalent cost
- Projections based on recent 7-day average
- Only counts days you actually used OpenCode

## Pitfalls

- **OpenCode vs Codex CLI**: This skill is for **OpenCode** only. OpenAI Codex CLI uses a completely separate session storage (`~/.codex/sessions/`) and model pricing. Do NOT use `opencode-cost` to check Codex usage — use the codex-usage-monitor.py script instead (see `references/codex-cli-monitoring.md`).
- **Database detection**: If `opencode-cost` can't find the database, run `find ~ -name "opencode.db" 2>/dev/null` and pass with `--db`.
- **Free models show estimates**: Free-tier OpenCode models are repriced at OpenRouter rates. Actual cost was $0, but the estimate shows what a paid equivalent would cost.
- **Session files cleared**: If you clear OpenCode session databases, historical data resets. The script only sees what's in the DB.
