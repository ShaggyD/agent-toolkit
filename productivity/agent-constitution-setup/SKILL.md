# Agent Constitution Setup

Build three documents that give AI agents deep context about who you are, where you're going, and what you're building. Framework developed by AI advisor Allie Miller: without these files, every AI interaction starts from a blank slate. With them, the agent operates from your actual context.

**Author:** Dustin "Dusty" Chadwick ([@ShaggyD](https://github.com/ShaggyD))

## The Three Files

### 1. Personal Constitution (timeless)
**What it is:** Your core values, decision-making framework, personality, and operating principles. Not tied to any year or week — this is the "who you are at your core" doc.

**Why it matters:** Without it, the agent has no compass for how you make decisions, what tradeoffs you'd make, or how to communicate with you. Every response is generic instead of *you*.

**How to build it:**
- Use scenarios, not direct questions. Give the user situations and ask their gut reaction. Examples: shipping imperfect work, pushing back on bad ideas, handling credit, deep work interruptions.
- Cross-reference with personality test results if available (MBTI, Big Five, Enneagram). Look for tensions between traits — the edges are where the constitution gets sharp.
- Include both strengths AND acknowledged weaknesses. A constitution that only flatters is useless.
- Iterate: draft, ask what doesn't sit right, rewrite. The user should feel slightly exposed — that's how you know it's real.

**Format:** Plain markdown, one heading. Save wherever your agent can access it (e.g. agent context, project files, a dedicated references directory).

### 2. Goals Document (time-bound)
**What it is:** Annual/quarterly/monthly goals, habits to build, habits to kick, specific inputs/outputs to manage.

**Why it matters:** Turns the agent from a dumb tool into something that proactively aligns with your trajectory. At minimum, the agent should know what you're optimizing for and what you're trying to change.

**How to build it:**
- Ask one category at a time: professional wins, personal routines, energy leaks.
- Focus on feelings first ("by December I want to feel like I finally ____"), then translate to specifics.
- Keep it lean. If it's longer than a screen, it won't get used.

**Format:** Plain markdown with sections. Filename includes the year (e.g. `goals-2026.md`).

### 3. Core Business Strategy (contextual)
**What it is:** What your business is, who you serve, who you don't serve, value proposition, and — critically — the things NOT on your website or LinkedIn. The failed podcast, the org that retreats to safety, the patterns that explain decisions.

**Why it matters:** Without it, the agent treats everything as equally important. With it, the agent knows what to say no to and why certain things failed before.

**How to build it:**
- Separate day job from side projects — different strategies, different audiences.
- Ask directly: "What's something true about this that you'd never put on a public slide deck?" That answer IS the strategy doc.
- Capture constraints, not just aspirations. Real strategy lives in the friction.

**Format:** Plain markdown with sections.

## Using These Documents

After building all three docs, integrate them into your agent's context:

1. **Store them where your agent can read them** — project files, a knowledge base, a dedicated references directory, clipboard, or custom instructions.
2. **Reference them explicitly** — tell your agent where to find them and when to load them (e.g. "Load these when planning, prioritizing, or making recommendations").
3. **Condense the constitution** into a short summary your agent always has — core values, decision-making style, communication preferences. Keep the full doc for detailed reference.
4. **Write an agent service standard** — the agent's equivalent of a goals doc. Defines what "good" looks like: escalation boundaries, proactivity ceiling, output quality bar, noise discipline. See `references/agent-service-standards.md` for a framework.
5. **Iterate** — these are living documents. Return to them quarterly and refine.

## Templates

This skill ships with two kinds of templates:

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `references/example-dusty-constitution.md` | **Real example** from Dustin Chadwick's personal constitution |
| `references/example-dusty-goals.md` | **Real example** from Dustin Chadwick's 2026 goals |
| `references/example-dusty-strategy.md` | **Real example** from Dustin Chadwick's business strategy |
| `templates/generic-constitution.md` | Placeholder template — replace with your own content |
| `templates/generic-goals.md` | Placeholder template — replace with your own content |
| `templates/generic-strategy.md` | Placeholder template — replace with your own content |

The real examples illustrate what the final output looks like. Start with the generic templates and replace the bracketed text.

## Interviewing Tips

- **One question at a time.** Don't dump categories. Let each answer breathe.
- **Scenarios beat abstractions.** "Here's a situation, what do you do?" surfaces real values faster than "what are your values?"
- **Push back on the draft.** If the user says "that doesn't sit right," dig into why. The rewrites are where the real self-knowledge emerges.
- **Save drafts.** Users will want to return and refine. These are living documents, not one-and-done.

## Pitfalls

- **Constitutions are NOT goals.** If an entry could reasonably change next year, it belongs in the goals doc, not the constitution.
- **Don't interview like a form.** If the user gives you a personality test result, use it. Cross-reference traits against what you've observed.
- **The third doc hurts.** If the business strategy doc is just marketing copy, you didn't go deep enough. The real strategy is what you'd tell a trusted advisor, not a customer.
- **Memory/context budget is finite.** A wall of text gets skimmed. Keep constitution values condensed into a short summary, with the full doc available for deep reference.
- **Files are portable.** Store them in a way that survives agent resets. Project files, a git repo, or a synced directory are better than ephemeral chat context.
